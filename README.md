Trading View Project

The Trading View Project is a custom trading strategy developed by Mohammad Sedaghat, a seasoned developer and strategist, and Saman Jalilian, a seasoned strategist with expertise in financial markets.
Overview

The project is built using TradingView, a powerful web-based charting platform for traders and investors. The custom strategy utilizes Bollinger Bands to identify potential entry and exit points for trades.

The strategy calculates the Bollinger Bands using a user-defined period length and multiplier. It then looks for crossovers of the price with the lower or upper Bollinger Bands to trigger buy or sell signals, respectively.

The custom strategy also includes dynamic stop loss and take profit targets, which adjust based on the percentage of the entry price specified by the user.
Usage

    Open the TradingView charting platform and navigate to the chart you want to analyze.
    Copy and paste the code provided by Mohammad Sedaghat into the TradingView Pine Editor.

    Customize the strategy parameters, including the Bollinger Bands period length, multiplier, stop loss percentage, and take profit percentage, as needed.
    Monitor the chart for potential buy or sell signals based on the strategy's rules.
    Open a position when a buy or sell signal is generated, and set the dynamic stop loss and take profit targets accordingly.
